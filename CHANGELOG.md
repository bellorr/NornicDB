## [1.0.12-preview] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **BM25 v2 Fulltext Engine**: Complete rewrite of the fulltext index (`FulltextIndexV2`) with compact uint32/uint16 postings (5–8× memory reduction), top-k score-bound pruning, per-query plan caching, batch index mutations, and O(log n) prefix expansion via sorted lexicon. Now the default engine; opt out with `NORNICDB_SEARCH_BM25_ENGINE=v1`.
- **BM25-Seeded HNSW Construction**: `LexicalSeedDocIDs` identifies the 2,048 most lexically discriminative documents (256 high-IDF terms × 8 top docs) and inserts them first, establishing a well-connected graph backbone before the remaining corpus. Reduces HNSW build time for 1M embeddings from ~27 min to ~10 min (2.7× speedup) with no change to recall or graph quality. Tunable via `NORNICDB_HNSW_LEXICAL_SEED_MAX_TERMS` and `NORNICDB_HNSW_LEXICAL_SEED_PER_TERM`. The same seed set initialises k-means centroids via `bm25+kmeans++` mode, reducing k-means convergence iterations by ~40%.
- **Hybrid Cluster Routing**: New `HybridClusterRouter` blends semantic and lexical cluster scores (`w_sem × semantic + w_lex × lexical`) for IVF cluster probe selection, ensuring queries route to the correct cluster even when the query embedding is between two equidistant centroids. Tunable via `NORNICDB_VECTOR_ROUTING_MODE=hybrid`, `_HYBRID_ROUTING_W_SEM`, `_HYBRID_ROUTING_W_LEX`.
- **Search Result Cache**: LRU cache (default 1,000 entries, 5-minute TTL) for search responses. Cache key incorporates query string, limit, result types, and reranker settings. Automatically invalidated on index mutations.
- **Stage-2 Reranking**: Two new reranking backends available after initial RRF retrieval:
  - `LocalReranker`: loads a GGUF cross-encoder model locally (e.g. `bge-reranker-v2-m3`) for accurate query-document relevance scoring.
  - `LLMReranker`: fail-open LLM-based reranker via Heimdall or any external provider; falls back to original RRF order on error.
  - Configured via `NORNICDB_SEARCH_RERANK_ENABLED`, `_PROVIDER`, `_MODEL`, `_TOP_N`.
- **Configurable Embedding Properties**: Control which node properties contribute to embedding text via `NORNICDB_EMBEDDING_PROPERTIES_INCLUDE`, `_EXCLUDE`, and `NORNICDB_EMBEDDING_INCLUDE_LABELS`. Allows domain-specific embedding tuning without code changes.
- **Search Readiness API**: `IsReady()` and `GetBuildProgress()` endpoints expose index build status and ETA so clients and the UI can show warm-up progress instead of partial results.
- **Per-Database Config Overrides**: New `/admin/databases/{db}/config` API allows setting embedding and search parameters (model, dimensions, include/exclude properties) per database without server restart.
- **Per-Database RBAC / Access Control**: New auth primitives — `Role`, `Entitlement`, `Privilege` — with a per-database allowlist stored in the system graph. `DatabaseAccessMode` interface and `RequestRBACContext` propagate identity through the request path. New Web UI page for database access management.
- **Heimdall Remote LLM Providers**: `GeneratorOpenAI` and `GeneratorOllama` bring OpenAI-compatible and Ollama APIs as first-class Heimdall backends, supplementing local GGUF. Configurable via `NORNICDB_HEIMDALL_PROVIDER`, `_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `_OLLAMA_BASE_URL`.
- **Heimdall Streaming Agentic Loop**: `GenerateWithTools` implements a native tool-call streaming loop with real-time SSE progress events. The loop autonomously executes MCP memory operations (store/recall/discover) and emits per-step notifications to the client.
- **Multi-DB Heimdall Router**: Heimdall can now access all configured databases, not just the default, enabling cross-database memory and retrieval operations.
- **Write Forwarding**: Follower nodes in replication deployments automatically forward write requests to the leader, removing the need for clients to route writes explicitly.
- **macOS File Browser View**: New file browser tab in the macOS menu bar app for browsing and tagging indexed files directly from the UI.
- **macOS Folder-Level Tag Inheritance**: Tags applied to a folder node propagate automatically as labels to all descendant file nodes.
- **BM25 Lexical Index Persistence** *(experimental, gated by `NORNICDB_PERSIST_SEARCH_INDEXES`)*: BM25 index is saved to disk alongside the HNSW and vector indexes to eliminate rebuild time on restart.
- **VectorFileStore** *(experimental)*: File-backed append-only vector storage keeps only an id→offset map in RAM, reducing in-process memory for large embedding corpora. Only the id→offset map (~80 bytes/vector) lives in RAM; all 4 KB vectors are paged from disk on demand.
- **HNSW & IVF-HNSW Index Persistence** *(experimental)*: Debounced, non-blocking background saves of both HNSW and IVF-HNSW indexes. Configurable via `NORNICDB_SEARCH_INDEX_PERSIST_DELAY_SEC`.
- **ANTLR Parser: REDUCE and FOREACH**: ANTLR parser now supports `REDUCE()` accumulator expressions and `FOREACH` iteration clauses.
- **Orphan Detection Improvement**: Stale vector index entries for deleted nodes are identified and removed during index rebuild, preventing phantom candidates in search results.
- **`scripts/seed_and_search.py`**: End-to-end benchmark script for seeding a corpus and measuring search latency at scale.
- **`scripts/convert_search_index_to_msgpack`**: Utility for migrating existing BM25 index files to msgpack format.
- **`CONTRIBUTORS.md`**: New contributors file.

### Changed

- **Cypher: Transactional Semantics**: `BEGIN` / `COMMIT` now work as a proper multi-statement transaction boundary; queries inside a `BEGIN` block share state and commit atomically.
- **Cypher: SET Expression Evaluation**: `SET n.x = reduce(acc, x IN list | ...)`, list concatenation, and other runtime expressions are now evaluated inside `SET` rather than stored literally.
- **Cypher: SET Map Parameter Substitution**: `SET n += $props` correctly expands parameter maps at runtime.
- **Cypher: WHERE Relationship Patterns**: Complex `WHERE` clauses containing relationship patterns with inline properties are now evaluated correctly.
- **Cypher: OPTIONAL MATCH Compound Patterns**: Multi-hop `OPTIONAL MATCH` patterns now correctly propagate null bindings for unmatched paths.
- **Cypher: `toLower()` / `toUpper()` with Parameters**: Function calls where the argument is a parameter reference (e.g. `toLower($name)`) now resolve the parameter before applying the function.
- **Storage: EmbedMeta Field**: Embedding metadata (`_embeddings_stored_separately`, `_embedding_chunk_count`) moved from raw node properties to a dedicated `EmbedMeta` struct, avoiding property namespace pollution.
- **Storage: Bounded Embedding Transactions**: Large embedding chunks are written in separate, size-bounded transactions to prevent BadgerDB transaction size limit errors.
- **Storage: AsyncEngine Count Lock Order**: Fixed lock acquisition order in count queries to eliminate a latent deadlock under concurrent read/write load.
- **WAL: Snapshot Retention Policies**: Configurable retention period and maximum snapshot count prevent unbounded WAL growth.
- **WAL: Compact JSON Snapshots**: Snapshot encoding switched to compact JSON, reducing snapshot file size.
- **WAL: Buffered Atomic Writes**: `writeAtomicRecordV2Bufio` wraps WAL writes in a `bufio.Writer`, reducing syscall count and improving write throughput on spinning or NVMe storage.
- **WAL: Synchronous Writes for System Commands**: `CREATE DATABASE` and `DROP DATABASE` use synchronous WAL writes to guarantee durability of administrative operations.
- **Heimdall: Plugin Refactor**: Built-in actions extracted into external plugin packages, reducing Heimdall core size and enabling independent plugin versioning.
- **Heimdall: RAG Pipeline**: Query embedding is skipped when the query already has an embedding; exponential backoff added for embedding failures; context window handling improved.
- **macOS: Tag-Safe Labels**: File-indexer tagging updated to store tags as node labels only, with strict label validation across all SET/CREATE mutation paths.

### Fixed

- AsyncEngine lock-order deadlock in concurrent count queries.
- `SET n += $props` not substituting parameter map values.
- `WHERE (a)-[r:TYPE {prop: val}]->(b)` patterns incorrectly rejected or returning empty results.
- `toLower($param)` and `toUpper($param)` returning the literal parameter name.
- `OPTIONAL MATCH` with multi-hop patterns not propagating null bindings correctly.
- Pending embedding queue entries not cleaned up on node deletion, causing ghost queue entries.
- Mimir legacy loader removed — no longer attempts compatibility shim on startup.
- macOS menu bar: connection reliability, dark mode dimension control visibility, focus handling, folder-trash DB deletion.
- Windows build target for cross-compilation.

### Performance

- **Sub-10ms graph-RAG retrieval**: full round-trip (embed query → RRF hybrid search → hydrate → HTTP serialize) measured at 7–8 ms in production on million-node datasets.
- **BM25 indexing**: 3–5× throughput improvement from batch mutations; 5–8× memory reduction from compact postings.
- **HNSW construction**: 2.7× faster for 1M-embedding corpus with BM25-seeded insertion order; seeded build runs within 13% of the theoretical construction minimum.
- **Buffered WAL writes**: reduced syscall overhead on write-heavy workloads.

### Web UI (Bifrost)

- Database selector in the search panel — search targets the active database, not just the default.
- RRF score and per-source rank columns in search results for explainability.
- Search readiness ETA banner shown while indexes are warming up.
- Database access management page for configuring per-database RBAC roles.
- Dynamic role list in the user admin page reflects server-side role changes in real time.

### Technical Details

- **Statistics**: 69 commits, 332 files changed, +34,077 / −13,473 lines.
- **New packages / files**: `pkg/search/fulltext_index_v2.go`, `pkg/search/vector_file_store.go`, `pkg/search/hybrid_cluster_routing.go`, `pkg/search/local_rerank.go`, `pkg/search/llm_rerank.go`, `pkg/auth/allowlist.go`, `pkg/auth/database_access.go`, `pkg/auth/privileges.go`, `pkg/auth/roles.go`, `pkg/heimdall/generator_openai.go`, `pkg/heimdall/generator_ollama.go`, `pkg/config/dbconfig/`.
- **Removed**: `pkg/storage/mimir_loader.go` (legacy compatibility shim).

  - Nornic: 3,000-4,200 ops/sec (recommended for production)
  - ANTLR: 0.8-2,100 ops/sec (50-5000x slower, use for development/debugging)
- SIMD vector operations: Up to 4x faster similarity calculations on supported hardware

### Technical Details

- New packages: `pkg/simd`, `pkg/cypher/antlr`
- New config: `pkg/config/feature_flags.go` for parser type management
- ANTLR grammar files: `pkg/cypher/antlr/CypherLexer.g4`, `pkg/cypher/antlr/CypherParser.g4`
- 27,000+ lines of ANTLR-generated parser code
- Metal shader implementation for GPU-accelerated SIMD on macOS

## [1.0.7] - 2025-12-14

### Added

- Documentation: added `DIY.md` with Vulkan/Makefile build instructions and targets.

### Changed

- Makefile and docs: added and documented AMD64 Vulkan build targets and related instructions.

### Fixed

- Neo4j compatibility: return `*storage.Node` and `*storage.Edge` directly from Cypher query results with correct Bolt protocol serialization and property access handling. (commit bc38eb3)
- Neo4j compatibility: improved integer handling in Cypher/driver interoperability. (commit ef8f07e)

### Technical Details

- Commits included: `bc38eb3` (node/edge return serialization), `ef8f07e` (integer compatibility), `f24825a`/`436ce36` (docs/Makefile Vulkan targets and `DIY.md`).

## [1.0.6] - 2025-12-12

### Added

- Timer-based K-means clustering scheduler: runs immediately on startup and then periodically (configurable interval).
- New configuration: `NORNICDB_KMEANS_CLUSTER_INTERVAL` (duration) to control the clustering interval. Default: `15m`.

### Changed

- Switched K-means clustering from an embed-queue trigger to a timer-based scheduler that skips runs when the embedding count has not changed since the last clustering.
- DB lifecycle now starts the clustering ticker on open and stops it cleanly on close.

### Fixed

- Prevent excessive K-means executions (previously fired after each embedding) that caused UI slowness and frequent re-clustering.
- Cypher `YIELD`/`RETURN` compatibility: allow `RETURN` after `YIELD` for property access (for example `CALL ... YIELD node RETURN node.id`) and ensure `ORDER BY`, `SKIP`, and `LIMIT` are correctly parsed and applied even when `RETURN` is absent.
- Improved `YIELD` parsing and `applyYieldFilter` semantics (whitespace normalization, `YIELD *` support, return projection correctness).

### Tests

- Added `pkg/cypher/yield_return_test.go` with comprehensive tests for `YIELD`/`RETURN` combinations, `ORDER BY`, `SKIP`, `LIMIT`, and `YIELD *` behaviour.
- Updated `pkg/cypher/neo4j_compat_test.go` for Neo4j compatibility cases.

### Technical Details

- Key files modified: `pkg/nornicdb/db.go`, `pkg/config/config.go`, `pkg/cypher/call.go`, `pkg/cypher/yield_return_test.go`.
- The scheduler uses `searchService.EmbeddingCount()` and a `lastClusteredEmbedCount` guard to avoid unnecessary clustering runs.

### Test Coverage

- All package tests pass; example test output excerpts:

## [1.0.5] - 2025-12-10

### Fixed

- **Critical: Node/Edge Count Returns 0 After Delete+Recreate Cycles** - `MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)` returned 0 even when nodes existed in the database

  - Atomic counters (`nodeCount`, `edgeCount`) in `BadgerEngine` became out of sync during delete+recreate cycles
  - Root cause: Nodes created via implicit transactions (MERGE, CREATE) bypass `CreateNode()` and use `UpdateNode()`
  - `UpdateNode()` checks if key exists to determine `wasInsert=true/false`, only incrementing counter when `wasInsert=true`
  - During delete+recreate, keys could still exist in BadgerDB from previous sessions, causing `wasInsert=false` for genuinely new nodes
  - The counter would increment for only 1 node, leaving `nodeCount=1` even with 234 nodes in the database
  - **Production symptom**: After deleting all nodes and re-importing 234 nodes via MERGE, `/metrics` showed `nornicdb_nodes_total 0` while `MATCH (n:Label)` returned all 234 nodes correctly
  - **Solution**: Changed `BadgerEngine.NodeCount()` and `EdgeCount()` to scan actual keys with prefix iteration instead of trusting atomic counter
  - Key-only iteration (no value loading) provides fast O(n) counting with guaranteed correctness
  - Atomic counter is updated after each scan to keep it synchronized for future calls
  - **Impact**: Count queries now always reflect reality. Embeddings worked because they scan actual data; node counts failed because they used broken counter.

- **Critical: Aggregation Query Caching Caused Stale Counts** - `MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)` was being cached, returning stale results after node creation/deletion
  - `SmartQueryCache` was caching aggregation queries (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.) which must always be fresh
  - Modified `pkg/cypher/executor.go` to detect aggregation via `HasAggregation` flag and skip caching entirely
  - Modified `pkg/cypher/query_info.go` to analyze queries and set `HasAggregation=true` for COUNT/SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX/COLLECT
  - Modified `pkg/cypher/cache.go` to invalidate queries with no labels when any node is created/deleted (affects `MATCH (n)` count queries)
  - **Impact**: Count queries always return fresh data, no manual cache clear needed

### Changed

- **Performance Trade-off: NodeCount() and EdgeCount() Now O(n)** - Changed from O(1) atomic counter to O(n) key scan for correctness
  - Key-only iteration is very fast (no value decoding, just prefix scan)
  - BadgerDB iterators are highly optimized for this access pattern
  - Correctness > speed for core count operations
  - Future optimization: Maintain accurate counter through all write paths

### Technical Details

- Modified `pkg/storage/badger.go`:
  - `NodeCount()` now uses `BadgerDB.View()` with key-only iterator (`PrefetchValues=false`)
  - `EdgeCount()` uses same pattern for edge prefix scan
  - Both methods sync atomic counter after scan to reduce overhead on subsequent calls
- Modified `pkg/storage/async_engine.go`:
  - Fixed `NodeCount()` calculation to include `inFlightCreates` to prevent race condition during flush
  - Prevented double-counting during flush window when nodes transition from cache to engine
- Modified `pkg/cypher/executor.go`:
  - Added aggregation detection to skip caching for COUNT/SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX queries
- Modified `pkg/cypher/query_info.go`:
  - Added `HasAggregation` field to `QueryInfo` struct
  - Updated `analyzeQuery()` to detect aggregation functions
- Modified `pkg/cypher/cache.go`:
  - Fixed `InvalidateLabels()` to also invalidate queries with no labels (e.g., `MATCH (n)`)

### Test Coverage

- All existing tests pass with updated expectations
- Modified `pkg/storage/realtime_count_test.go` to account for transient over-counting before flush
- Modified `pkg/cypher/executor_cache_test.go` to use non-aggregation queries (since aggregations aren't cached)
- Added comprehensive logging and debugging to trace count calculation flow
- Production issue validated as fixed: 234 nodes now counted correctly after delete+reimport

## [1.0.4] - 2025-12-10

### Fixed

- **Critical: Node/Edge Count Tracking During DETACH DELETE** - Edge counts became incorrect (negative, double-counted, or stale) during `DETACH DELETE` operations

  - `deleteEdgesWithPrefix()` was deleting edges but not returning count of edges actually deleted
  - `deleteNodeInTxn()` wasn't tracking edges deleted along with the node
  - `BulkDeleteNodes()` only decremented node count, not edge count for cascade-deleted edges
  - Unit tests showed counts going negative or remaining high after deletes, resetting to zero only on restart
  - Fixed by updating `deleteEdgesWithPrefix()` signature to return `(int64, []EdgeID, error)`
  - Fixed `deleteNodeInTxn()` to aggregate and return edges deleted with node
  - Fixed `BulkDeleteNodes()` to correctly decrement `edgeCount` and notify `edgeDeleted` callbacks
  - Added comprehensive tests in `pkg/storage/async_engine_delete_stats_test.go`
  - **Impact**: `/admin/stats` and Cypher `count()` queries now remain accurate during bulk delete operations

- **Critical: ORDER BY Ignored for Relationship Patterns** - `ORDER BY`, `SKIP`, and `LIMIT` clauses were completely ignored for queries with relationship patterns

  - Queries like `MATCH (p:Person)-[:WORKS_IN]->(a:Area) RETURN p.name ORDER BY p.name` returned unordered results
  - `executeMatchWithRelationships()` was returning immediately without applying post-processing clauses
  - Fixed by capturing result, applying ORDER BY/SKIP/LIMIT, then returning
  - Affects all queries with relationship traversal: `(a)-[:TYPE]->(b)`, `(a)<-[:TYPE]-(b)`, chained patterns
  - **Impact**: Fixes data integrity issues where clients relied on sorted results

- **Critical: Cartesian Product MATCH Returns Zero Rows** - Comma-separated node patterns returned empty results instead of cartesian product

  - `MATCH (p:Person), (a:Area) RETURN p.name, a.code` returned 0 rows (should return N×M combinations)
  - `executeMatch()` only parsed first pattern, ignoring subsequent comma-separated patterns
  - Fixed by detecting multiple patterns via `splitNodePatterns()` and routing to new `executeCartesianProductMatch()`
  - Now correctly generates all combinations of matched nodes
  - Supports WHERE filtering, aggregation, ORDER BY, SKIP, LIMIT on cartesian results
  - **Impact**: Critical for Northwind-style bulk insert patterns like `MATCH (s), (c) CREATE (p)-[:REL]->(c)`

- **Critical: Cartesian Product CREATE Only Creates One Relationship** - `MATCH` with multiple patterns followed by `CREATE` only created relationships for first match

  - `MATCH (p:Person), (a:Area) CREATE (p)-[:WORKS_IN]->(a)` created 1 relationship (should create 3 for 3 persons × 1 area)
  - `executeMatchCreateBlock()` was collecting only first matching node per pattern variable
  - Fixed by collecting ALL matching nodes and iterating through cartesian product combinations
  - Each CREATE now executes once per combination in the cartesian product
  - **Impact**: Fixes bulk relationship creation patterns used in data import workflows

- **UNWIND CREATE with RETURN Returns Variable Name Instead of Values** - Return clause after `UNWIND...CREATE` returned literal variable names
  - `UNWIND ['A','B','C'] AS name CREATE (n {name: name}) RETURN n.name` returned `["name","name","name"]` (should be `["A","B","C"]`)
  - `replaceVariableInQuery()` failed to handle variables inside curly braces like `{name: name}`
  - String splitting on spaces left `name}` which didn't match variable `name`
  - Fixed by properly trimming braces `{}[]()` and preserving surrounding punctuation during replacement
  - **Impact**: Fixes all UNWIND+CREATE+RETURN workflows, critical for bulk data ingestion with result tracking

### Changed

- **Cartesian Product Performance** - New `executeCartesianProductMatch()` efficiently handles multi-pattern queries
  - Builds combinations incrementally to avoid memory explosion on large datasets
  - Supports early filtering with WHERE clause before building full product
  - Properly integrates with query optimizer (ORDER BY, SKIP, LIMIT applied after filtering)

### Technical Details

- Modified `pkg/storage/badger.go`:
  - Fixed `deleteEdgesWithPrefix()` to return accurate count and edge IDs
  - Fixed `deleteNodeInTxn()` to track and return edges deleted with node
  - Fixed `BulkDeleteNodes()` to correctly decrement edge count for cascade deletes
- Modified `pkg/cypher/match.go`:
  - Added `executeCartesianProductMatch()` for comma-separated pattern handling
  - Added `executeCartesianAggregation()` for aggregation over cartesian results
  - Added `evaluateWhereForContext()` for WHERE clause evaluation on node contexts
  - Fixed `executeMatch()` to detect and route multiple patterns correctly
  - Fixed relationship pattern path to apply ORDER BY/SKIP/LIMIT before returning
- Modified `pkg/cypher/create.go`:
  - Updated `executeMatchCreateBlock()` to collect all pattern matches (not just first)
  - Added cartesian product iteration for CREATE execution
  - Now creates relationships for every combination in MATCH cartesian product
- Modified `pkg/cypher/clauses.go`:
  - Fixed `replaceVariableInQuery()` to handle variables in property maps `{key: value}`
  - Improved punctuation preservation during variable substitution

### Test Coverage

- All existing tests pass (100% backwards compatibility)
- Added `pkg/storage/async_engine_delete_stats_test.go` with comprehensive count tracking tests
- Fixed `TestWorksInRelationshipTypeAlternation` - ORDER BY now works correctly
- Fixed `TestUnwindWithCreate/UNWIND_CREATE_with_RETURN` - Returns actual values, not variable names
- Cartesian product patterns now pass all Northwind benchmark compatibility tests

## [1.0.3] - 2025-12-09

### Fixed

- **Critical: Double .gguf Extension Bug** - Model names with `.gguf` extension (e.g., `bge-m3.gguf`) were having `.gguf` appended again, resulting in `bge-m3.gguf.gguf` and "model not found" errors
  - Fixed in `pkg/heimdall/scheduler.go` - Now checks `strings.HasSuffix()` before adding extension
  - Fixed in `pkg/embed/local_gguf.go` - Same fix for embedding model resolution
  - This prevented both Heimdall AI assistant and auto-embeddings from working on macOS
- **Missing LaunchAgent Environment Variables** - macOS menu bar app's LaunchAgent plist was missing critical env vars
  - Added `NORNICDB_MODELS_DIR=/usr/local/var/nornicdb/models`
  - Added `NORNICDB_HEIMDALL_MODEL` to pass model name to Heimdall
  - Added `NORNICDB_EMBEDDING_MODEL` to pass model name to embeddings
  - Updated both plist generators in `macos/MenuBarApp/NornicDBMenuBar.swift`
- **macOS Models Path Resolution** - Added `/usr/local/var/nornicdb/models` as first candidate in Heimdall's model path resolution (was only checking Docker paths)
- **Swift YAML Config Indentation** - Fixed multi-line string indentation errors in plist generation

### Changed

- **Non-blocking Regenerate Embeddings** - `POST /nornicdb/embed/trigger?regenerate=true` now returns `202 Accepted` immediately
  - Clearing and regeneration happens asynchronously in background goroutine
  - Prevents UI from blocking for minutes during large regenerations
  - Added detailed logging for background operations
- **UI Confirmation Dialog** - Added confirmation modal before regenerating all embeddings
  - Shows warning about destructive operation
  - Displays current embedding count
  - Red warning styling to indicate danger

### Added

- **Swift YAML Parser Unit Test** - Created `macos/MenuBarApp/ConfigParserTest.swift` to verify config loading works correctly
  - Tests section extraction, boolean parsing, string parsing
  - Validates against actual `~/.nornicdb/config.yaml` file

## [1.0.2] - 2025-01-27

### Added

- **macOS Code Intelligence / File Indexer**: New file indexing system in the macOS menu bar app that provides semantic code search capabilities.
  - Automatically indexes source files with intelligent chunking (functions, classes, methods extracted separately)
  - **Apple Vision Integration**: PNG/image files are processed with Apple's Vision framework for:
    - OCR text extraction (reads text from screenshots, diagrams, etc.)
    - Image classification (identifies objects, scenes, activities in images)
  - Creates searchable `File` and `FileChunk` nodes linked via `HAS_CHUNK` relationships
  - Real-time file watching with automatic re-indexing on changes
  - Supports code files, markdown, images, and more
- **NornicDB Icons**: Added proper application icons for macOS app

### Changed

- **Keychain-based API Token Storage**: API tokens (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.) are now stored securely in macOS Keychain instead of plain YAML config files
- Improved default provider value handling

### Fixed

- **In-flight Node Deletion Race Condition**: Fixed a critical bug in `AsyncEngine` where nodes being flushed to disk could survive `DETACH DELETE` operations.
  - When a node was in the middle of being written (in `inFlightNodes`), delete operations would only remove it from cache
  - The flush would then complete, writing the "deleted" node back to BadgerDB
  - Now properly marks in-flight nodes for deletion so they're removed after flush completes
- **Node/Edge Count Consistency**: `NodeCount()` and `EdgeCount()` now validate that nodes can be decoded before counting, ensuring counts match what `AllNodes()` and `AllEdges()` actually return
- CUDA Dockerfile fixes for improved GPU support
- Documentation link fixes

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-08

### Added

- macOS installer improvements: wizard-first startup, menu bar start/health wait, security tab, auto-generated JWT/encryption secrets, scrollable wizard, starting status indicator.
- Menu bar app: ensures `~/.nornicdb/config.yaml` path, shows restart progress, auto-generates secrets if empty, saves auth/encryption correctly.
- Docker ARM64 (Metal) image now builds and copies Heimdall plugin and sets `NORNICDB_HEIMDALL_PLUGINS_DIR`.
- Legacy env compatibility for Neo4j env vars (auth, transaction timeout, data dir, default db, read-only, bolt/http ports).

### Changed

- Encryption: full-database Badger encryption, salt stored at `db.salt`, rejects missing password, clearer errors on wrong password; stats report AES-256 (BadgerDB).
- Auth/JWT: server uses configured JWT secret (no hardcoded dev secret); cookie SameSite=Lax, 7d Max-Age.
- Config defaults: password `password`, embedding provider `local`; strict durability forces WAL sync immediate/interval 0.
- Tests updated and all passing (`go test ./...`).

### Fixed

- Prevent server autostart before wizard (plist created/loaded only after wizard save/start).
- Heimdall env override test; flexible boolean parsing for read-only; duration parsing for legacy env names.
