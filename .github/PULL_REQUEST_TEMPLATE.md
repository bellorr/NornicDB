## Testing
<!-- Describe the tests you ran and how to reproduce them -->

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Added tests for new functionality
- [ ] Updated tests for changed functionality
- [ ] All tests pass locally (`go test ./...`)
- [ ] Coverage maintained at ≥90% (`go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...`)

### Manual Testing
<!-- Describe manual testing performed -->
1. 
2. 
3. 

## Performance Impact
<!-- Required for all code changes -->

### Benchmarks
<!-- Run benchmarks before and after your changes -->
```bash
# Before
go test ./pkg/cypher -bench=. -benchmem

# After
go test ./pkg/cypher -bench=. -benchmem
```

**Results:**
- Query execution: [e.g., no change, 2x faster, 10% slower]
- Memory usage: [e.g., no change, -15% reduction, +5% increase]
- Justification (if regression): [explain why the performance trade-off is acceptable]

## Neo4j Compatibility
<!-- If this changes Cypher behavior -->
- [ ] Tested against Neo4j for compatibility
- [ ] Behavior matches Neo4j exactly
- [ ] Not applicable (internal change only)

## Documentation
- [ ] Updated relevant documentation in `/docs`
- [ ] Updated CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Added code comments for complex logic
- [ ] Updated README.md (if user-facing change)
