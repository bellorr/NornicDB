## Analysis

### Key Findings

With memory optimizations (executor caching + search service reuse) enabled:
- ✅ **100 streams provides slightly higher throughput** (37,450 req/s vs 37,093 req/s for 250)
- ✅ **Significantly better tail latency** (P99: 4.12ms vs 10.18ms for 250)
- ✅ **Lower high-percentile latency under load** (P95/P99/P99.9 all improved)
- ✅ **Much better median and average latency** (P50/avg both improved by ~60%)
- ✅ **No errors** - 100% success rate maintained
- ✅ **89% reduction in memory growth** during load

### Why 100 Streams Performs Best

With 100 concurrent connections:
- Each connection can handle up to 100 streams (with MaxStreams=100)
- Total potential: 100 × 100 = 10,000 concurrent streams
- Actual usage: ~50,000 requests total, distributed across 100 connections
- **100 streams provides optimal balance** - sufficient capacity without overhead

The performance advantage of 100 streams comes from:
1. **Lower memory overhead** - fewer stream buffers per connection
2. **Better resource utilization** - optimal for this workload size
3. **Reduced queuing** - streams complete faster, reducing tail latency
4. **Memory optimizations eliminate per-request overhead** (executor + search service caching)

### Tail Latency Improvement

The **59.5% improvement in P99 latency** (10.18ms → 4.12ms) with 100 streams is the most significant benefit:
- Fewer requests waiting for stream availability
- Better load distribution across connections
- Reduced queuing when connection limits are hit
- **Sub-5ms P99 latency** - excellent for high-concurrency workloads

## Recommendations

### For High-Concurrency Workloads

**Use MaxConcurrentStreams = 100 when:**
- ✅ **Best performance** - highest throughput and lowest latency
- ✅ **Optimal for 100 concurrent connections** - as tested
- ✅ **Lower memory usage** - fewer stream buffers
- ✅ **Better security** - DoS protection with lower limits
- ✅ **Standard web workloads** - sufficient for most use cases

**Use MaxConcurrentStreams = 250 when:**
- ✅ You need Go's default behavior (matches standard library)
- ✅ You have many more concurrent clients (200+)
- ✅ Each client makes many parallel requests
- ✅ Memory usage is not a concern

### Current Default: 250

The default is **250** (Go's internal default) to:
- Match standard library behavior
- Provide good balance for most workloads
- Allow flexibility for high-concurrency scenarios

**However, for optimal performance with ~100 concurrent connections, 100 streams provides better results.**

## Conclusion

**MaxConcurrentStreams = 100 (with memory optimizations) provides stronger tail-latency performance:**
- ✅ **Slightly higher throughput** (37,451 req/s vs 37,093 req/s for 250)
- ✅ **59.5% P99 latency improvement** (4.12ms vs 10.18ms for 250) - most significant
- ✅ **63.7% P95 latency improvement** (3.25ms vs 8.95ms for 250)
- ✅ **60.3% average latency improvement** (2.67ms vs 6.72ms for 250)
- ✅ **89% reduction in memory growth** during load
- ✅ **No performance regressions**
- ✅ **100% success rate maintained**

The combination of `MaxConcurrentStreams = 100` and memory optimizations (executor caching + search service reuse) provides stronger tail-latency behavior for high-concurrency database workloads. The **sub-5ms P99 latency** (4.12ms) demonstrates excellent performance. While the default is 250 (matching Go's standard library), **100 streams is recommended when tail latency is the priority** with ~100 concurrent connections.
